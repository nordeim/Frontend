I need to create a frontend that:
- Integrates with the existing WebSocket infrastructure
- Consumes the API endpoints properly
- Follows PRD v4 requirements for accessibility, responsiveness
- Implements proper TypeScript strict mode
- Has comprehensive testing

From an analysis of the documents, Phase 8 is:
**Phase 8: Frontend (React + TS)** - 7 days duration
- Frontend application with React + TypeScript
- Strict typing, responsive design, accessibility
- Storybook for component development
- Component and unit tests

The files specified are:
- frontend/{package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, .env.example}
- frontend/src/components/Chat/{ChatWindow.tsx, MessageList.tsx, MessageInput.tsx, TypingIndicator.tsx}
- frontend/src/components/Layout/{Header.tsx, Sidebar.tsx}
- frontend/src/store/{index.ts, slices/{authSlice.ts, conversationSlice.ts, uiSlice.ts}}
- frontend/src/services/{api.ts, websocket.ts}
- frontend/src/hooks/{useChat.ts}

Now please meticulously review and analyze the current codebase at GitHub repo URL https://github.com/nordeim/Frontend/tree/main to understand whether the codebase complies with Phase 8 Frontend Implementation Plan below. Then create a detailed comprehensive assessment report in markdown format to clearly describe in detail the current state of the frontend codebase and whther it complies with the PRD v4 and `Coding Execution Plan v3`. Next create a comprehensive execution plan to update and complete the frontend codebase to meet the project requirements.

# Phase 8 Implement Plan

This execution plan outlines a systematic approach to implement Phase 8 (Frontend - React + TypeScript) of the `Coding Execution Plan v3`. Based on meticulous analysis of the completed Phases 1-7 infrastructure and comprehensive review of PRD v4 requirements, this plan ensures full compliance with accessibility, performance, and technical specifications.

# Comprehensive `Coding Execution Plan v3`
## AI Customer Service Agent for Salesforce

### Document Purpose
A single, production-ready execution plan that merges the concrete engineering rigor of v2 with the breadth and delivery clarity of v1, and extends both to fully align with PRD v4. This plan is optimized for parallel development by AI coding agents with clear interfaces, contracts, validation gates, and SRE-grade operational readiness.

---

## 🎯 Strategy, Standards, and Principles

### Core Principles
1. Contract-first: Define interfaces, schemas, and APIs before implementation.
2. Phase independence: Each phase yields shippable increments with validation gates.
3. Parallelization: Maximize parallel builds with explicit dependency graph.
4. Quality gates: Enforce test coverage, typing, linting, and security scans.
5. Production-first: Logging, metrics, authN/Z, and error handling from day one.
6. Observability-by-design: Correlation IDs, metrics, traces, dashboards.

### Technical Standards
- Python 3.11+ with full type hints; TypeScript 5.3+ strict mode.
- Async I/O across services; no blocking I/O in request paths.
- Testing: TDD mindset; coverage ≥85% unit, integration, and E2E suites.
- Security: Zero-trust posture; OWASP hardening; secret hygiene; field encryption.
- Docs: OpenAPI 3.0; inline docstrings; runbooks for SRE.

## 9. Data Model (Summary)

### 9.1 PostgreSQL 16 Schemas
- core: organizations, users, conversations, messages, actions, escalations
- ai: knowledge_entries, intents, model_performance, learning_feedback
- analytics: materialized views (conversation_metrics, intent_metrics)
- audit: partitioned activity_log, privacy_log
- RLS: org isolation across tables using `app.current_org_id`

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pg_trgm";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgvector";
-- Example: Conversations (core)
CREATE TABLE core.conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  channel VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  started_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  last_activity_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  resolution_time_seconds INTEGER,
  ai_confidence_avg DECIMAL(4,3),
  sentiment_score_avg DECIMAL(4,3),
  context JSONB DEFAULT '{}'
);
```

## 10. AI Model Strategy & Guardrails

- Model portfolio: GPT-4 Turbo (primary), Claude-3 (secondary), local CodeLlama for code gen fallback
- Fine-tuning plan for Salesforce domain datasets (Apex/SOQL/config/logs/conversations)
- Guardrails: content filters, grounded answers with citations, confidence thresholds, human-in-the-loop on critical responses, red-teaming, jailbreak resistance tests in CI

---

## 11. Testing & Quality Assurance

### 11.1 Test Strategy

    dast: "OWASP ZAP"
    deps: "Snyk"
  chaos:
    scenarios: ["cache outage", "api rate limit exhaustion", "metadata deploy failure"]
```

### 11.2 Example Test (E2E)
```python
# tests/integration/test_conversation_flow.py
async def test_conversation_lifecycle(async_client, mock_openai):
    r = await async_client.post("/api/v1/conversations", json={"user_id":"...", "channel":"web"})
    assert r.status_code == 201
    conv_id = r.json()["id"]
    r = await async_client.post(f"/api/v1/conversations/{conv_id}/messages", json={"content":"I forgot my password"})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    assert r.json()["confidence"] >= 0.8
