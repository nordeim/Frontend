your meticulous assessment of the current frontend codebase is exemplary! please keep up the good work! now help to complete phase 1 of your remedial plan. please create complete *drop-in* replacement file for each file that needs updating or new files to be created. enclose each generated file within ```ts or ```tsx or ```js tags and add a comment line at the start of each file that contains the full file path relative to the codebase root directory.

please think deeper and think harder to explore thoroughly and carefully for the best implementation option to update/add the files in phase 1 of your remedial plan, then meticulously create a detailed comprehensive execution plan to create the complete replacement files, include a checklist for each file to be created/updated. review and validate your comprehensive plan for the phase 1 remedial plan before proceeding cautiously. remember to validate the files against the checklist after creation. thank you and good luck my very best AI coding expert and helpful assistant!
