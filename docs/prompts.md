your meticulous assessment of the current frontend codebase is exemplary! please keep up the good work! now help to complete phase 1 of your remedial plan. please create complete *drop-in* replacement file for each file that needs updating or new files to be created. enclose each generated file within ```ts or ```tsx or ```js tags and add a comment line at the start of each file that contains the full file path relative to the codebase root directory.

please think deeper and think harder to explore thoroughly and carefully for the best implementation option to update/add the files in phase 1 of your remedial plan, then meticulously create a detailed comprehensive execution plan to create the complete replacement files, include a checklist for each file to be created/updated. review and validate your comprehensive plan for the phase 1 remedial plan before proceeding cautiously. remember to validate the files against the checklist after creation. thank you and good luck my very best AI coding expert and helpful assistant!

Wow, you are truly awesome meticulous AI assistant and partner whom I can absolutely trust to deliver dependable documentations. please keep up the good work! now help me think deeper and think harder how to meticulously review and validate line by line the PAD document at URL https://github.com/nordeim/Frontend/blob/main/Project%20Architecture%20Document.md using your deep understanding of the current project codebase based on all your thorough scanning and review of the GitHub repo at URL https://github.com/nordeim/Frontend/tree/main. Please create a complete updated replacement document for the PAD with more accurate information. add a mermaid diagram to accurately describe the application flow as well as the interactions between various modules. Your complete replacement PAD will serve as the authoritative truth for the actual codebase at the GitHub repo. Scan the actual files in the GitHub repo to validate their relationships. thank you my very best AI code partner!

Please help me create the complete and comprehensive Project Architecture Document based on the meticulous execution plan to be developed first. This is a significant undertaking that requires you to synthesize all the analysis carried out on the current codebase, including the envisioned improvements from your deep exploration, and the detailed outline for the PAD structure.

Think deeper and think harder to explore carefully and thoroughly how to plan and then create a complete, comprehensive PAD using the following framework/outline as your reference guide:

1. Executive Summary - High-level overview of the architecture
2. Architecture Philosophy - Core design principles and constraints
3. System Architecture - High-level diagrams and system boundaries
4. Technology Stack Architecture - Detailed tech choices with rationale
5. Component Architecture - Component hierarchy and design patterns
6. Service Layer Architecture - API, WebSocket, and service patterns
7. State Management Architecture - Redux structure and data flow
8. Real-Time Architecture - WebSocket implementation and patterns
9. Accessibility Architecture - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance details
10. Performance Architecture - Optimization strategies and benchmarks
11. Security Architecture - Security layers and best practices
12. Mobile Architecture - PWA and responsive design patterns
13. Development Architecture - Development workflow and tooling
14. Monitoring and Observability - Metrics, logging, and tracing
15. Security and Compliance - Compliance frameworks and audits
16. Future Architecture Considerations - Roadmap and evolution plans

You will structure it as a complete architectural document that could serve as the definitive reference for the project. And it needs to be comprehensive, detailed, and production-ready.
