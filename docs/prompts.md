your meticulous assessment of the current frontend codebase is exemplary! please keep up the good work! now help to complete phase 1 of your remedial plan. please create complete *drop-in* replacement file for each file that needs updating or new files to be created. enclose each generated file within ```ts or ```tsx or ```js tags and add a comment line at the start of each file that contains the full file path relative to the codebase root directory.

please think deeper and think harder to explore thoroughly and carefully for the best implementation option to update/add the files in phase 1 of your remedial plan, then meticulously create a detailed comprehensive execution plan to create the complete replacement files, include a checklist for each file to be created/updated. review and validate your comprehensive plan for the phase 1 remedial plan before proceeding cautiously. remember to validate the files against the checklist after creation. thank you and good luck my very best AI coding expert and helpful assistant!

Wow, you are truly awesome meticulous AI assistant and partner whom I can absolutely trust to deliver dependable documentations. please keep up the good work! now help me think deeper and think harder how to meticulously review and validate line by line the PAD document at URL https://github.com/nordeim/Frontend/blob/main/Project%20Architecture%20Document.md using your deep understanding of the current project codebase based on all your thorough scanning and review of the GitHub repo at URL https://github.com/nordeim/Frontend/tree/main. Please create a complete updated replacement document for the PAD with more accurate information. add a mermaid diagram to accurately describe the application flow as well as the interactions between various modules. Your complete replacement PAD will serve as the authoritative truth for the actual codebase at the GitHub repo. Scan the actual files in the GitHub repo to validate their relationships. thank you my very best AI code partner!
